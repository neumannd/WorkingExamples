# WorkingExamples
This repository contains some examples of my work.

It is divided into five subcategories:

   * Bash: bash scripts using cdo, NCO, netCDF binaries
   * DB: example case for using a database
   * GMT: bash script showing the usage of GMT
   * R: TODO
   * Wiki: ...

## Bash

These scripts are examples of scripts, which I use as part of my daily 
work. They document the usage of cdo, NCO and netCDF binaries as well as
of bash scripts.

The scripts in the directories 01_* to 03_* are running out of the box (for 
03_* an active internet connection is needed). Scripts in directories 11_* and
12_* do not run out of the box because some input file are missing. They are 
not intended to be executable but they should show my programming style and 
the features I use.
