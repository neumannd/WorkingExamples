One script to create a input netCDF file for a model run.

~~~ make_ocean_quick.sh ~~~
This script creates an OCEANfile for CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality 
Model). CMAQ uses CMAS-IOAPI, which is an 'add-on'-library to netCDF. IOAPI 
uses a specific set of global attributes. IOAPI seems to access variables not 
by name but by their index in the netCDF file. Thesefore, variables in netCDF 
input files for CMAQ need to be in a specific order.

This script creates a netCDF file with the specific variable order and with 
the needed global attributes.

This script cleans up automatically. Please comment out the last line to 
prevent it from doing the cleanup.

Needed file: ./GRIDCRO/GRIDCRO2D_cd24_2012001

Location of the output file: ./OCEAN
