---++ General Information

   * EMEP is the _European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme_ within the _Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution_ (CLRTAP)
   * EMEP consists of several research centers distributed over Europe that focus on different aspects of air pollution
   * for model data see for details: [[http://emep.int/mscw/index_mscw.html]]
   * for measurement data see for details: [[http://ebas.nilu.no]]

---++ Data source

   * EMEP programme, reporting of 2016
   * source: [[http://thredds.met.no/thredds/catalog/data/EMEP/2016_Reporting/catalog.html]]
   * if they rename it, look here: [[http://thredds.met.no/thredds/catalog.html]]
   * overview page: [[http://emep.int/mscw/index_mscw.html]]

---++ Variables:

raw data ('org' folder):

   * wet and dry deposition of
      * oxidized nitrogen
      * reduced nitrogen
      * oxidized sulfure
   * precipitation
   * ground level concentrations of some air pollutants

processed data:

   * wet, dry, and total deposition of
      * oxidized nitrogen
      * reduced nitrogen

---++ documentation of data processsing

   * interpolate data onto another grid
   * remove some variables
   * split it into daily files

The scripts for processing the data are located in the /data/atmdep/EMEP_2016_reporting/scripts_HBM-ERGOM folder
   * interpolate data: process_emep_grid_v0.1.sh
   * split data into daily files: extract_emep_daily_dep_v0.1.sh

For linking to files with yyyyddd (day of year; no month) names use the scripts in /data/atmdep/EMEP_2016_reporting/scripts_dayOfYear_2_yyyymmddhh:
   * idea: have the files with 'yyyyddd' names but create links with 'yyyymmdd', which point to the 'yyyyddd' files; link_dating.sh

---++ time span

   * temporal coverage: 2000 to 2013
   * daily average values

---++ regional coverage

   * North and Baltic Sea
   * Europe
   * 50 x 50 km2 spatial grid resolution

---++ data gaps

   * none

---++ place of storage

   * original data: /data/atmdep/EMEP_2016_reporting/org
   * processed data (for HBM-ERGOM): /data/atmdep/EMEP_2016_reporting/hbm-ergom

---++ data security strategy

   * NONE
   * data are currently stored at HLRN; I will write them onto tape there; when I leave, my account is removed and the data deleted

---++ How to cite?
