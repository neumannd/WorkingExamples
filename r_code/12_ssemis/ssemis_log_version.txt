v3.7.0
 - spada/martensson emission function:
   -- the user can choose between three salinity dependencies:
       (1) everything (NUM, SRF and MASS) are scaled by SAL/35
       (2) NUM is not scaled
           SRF is scaled by (SAL/35)^(2/3)
           MASS and VOL are scaled by SAL/35
           (1st moment would be scaled by (SAL/35)^(1/3))
       (3) The same as (2) but additionally the source functions is shifted
           by (SAL/35)^(1/3) (if SAL is lower then smaller particles are 
           generated).
 - some minor changes which I forgot

v3.8.0
 - 2015-Jun-25
 - reordering of functions into different scripts:
   -- ssemis_params:    parameters
   -- ssemis_funs:      functions generally used independent of the emission
                         parameterisation
   -- ssemis_calc_sp13: function with emission parameterisation suggested by
                         Spada et al. (2013)
   -- ssemis_calc_go03: function with emission parameterisation derived by
                         Gong (2003)
   -- ssemis_calc_ov14: function with emission parameterisation derived by
                         Ovadnevaite (2014); CURRENTLY NOT WORKING 
   -- ssemis_main_*:    main programms to source the R scripts and call the 
                         integration routines
   -- ssemis_inti:      some functions for providing that appropriate versions
                         of the individual sets of functions are used

v3.8.1
 - 2015-Jun-26
 - modifications in ssemis_calc_sp13:
   -- a warning is thrown when surface emissions below 0 are emitted
   -- if the read in salinity (tmpSAL) is NaN it is replaced by 0
   -- if the read in sst (tmpSST) is NaN it is replaced by 273

v3.8.2
 - 2015-Jun-26 to 2015-Jul-05
 - modifications in ssemis_calc_sp13:
   -- There were several if cases distinguishing between u10 < 9 m/s and 
      u10 >= 9 m/s. The number of if calls was reduced and the code was
      shortened.
 - modifications in ssemis_calc_go03:
   -- code cleaning / minor changes
 - modifications in ssemis_calc_ov13:
   -- The tnf function was modified in order to deal with 'Re' < 1e+5
 - modifications in ssemis_params:
   -- added variables for base input and output directories:
       dBASEIN1, dBASEIN2 and dBASEOUT
 - modifications in ssemis_funs:
   -- new function: get_griddesc; replaces the need for loading cmaqtools
   -- modification: calc_viscosityWater_a; unit 'K' is used for SST
 - modifications in SW_tools.R
   -- There was a problem with parsing NA values to the functions. This
      problem was solved
 
v3.8.3
 - modifications in ssemis_calc_go03:
 - modifications in ssemis_main_*:
   -- All input and output directories are defined in the ssemis_params
      and taken from there. In the ssemis_main_* the read from the
      variable namespace$BASE$IN1, IN2 and OUT.
   -- cmaqtools are not loaded anymore and the griddesc() function is
      not used anymore. Instead, the function get_griddesc() from the
      ssemis_funs is used now.
 - modifications in ssemis_funs:
   -- new function: get_griddesc(); it has the same function as
      cmaqtools::griddesc()
 - modifications in ssemis_calc_sp13:
   -- The integration boundary between J and K mode (bJK) was used in a 
      wrong context. bJK has the same size and dimensions as the input
      and output data. Now tmpBJK is introduced which is set to 
      bJK[iCol,iRow,iT] in each loop iteration.
   -- In the case sal==3 wrong integration boundaries for the Monahan/
      Smith parameterisations at the far right end of the size spectrum
      were set.
   -- The Martensson Parameterisation for the third particle size interval
      becomes negative in some situation. Negative values are set to 0 (since
      version 3.8.0). The integration routine might throw an error if large
      parts of a functions are constant - especially 0 (zero). This may only
      happen in the sal=3 mode. New: In situations in which this might happen, 
      the error is suppressed and a warning is thrown. The warning contains 
      information on the integration boundaries and the grid indices 
      (row, col and time) in order to easily reproduce the error.
 - modifications in ssemis_calc_go03:
   -- The integration boundary between J and K mode (bJK) was used in a 
      wrong context. bJK has the same size and dimensions as the input
      and output data. Now tmpBJK is introduced which is set to 
      bJK[iCol,iRow,iT] in each loop iteration.
 - modifications in ssemis_calc_ov13:
   -- In the conversion from dF/dlog(D) to dF/dD the 1/ln(10) had been
      forgotten.
   -- There is still some debugging code present which was commented out.
      In the next version it could be removed.
      
      
v3.8.4
 - general:
   -- new name conventions for the output file:
       "ssemis_${GRID_NAME}_ae${AERO}_OC${SURF}${SAL}_${FUN}_mode${MODE}_${DATE}"
       with: GRID_NAME = upper case grid name (CD06, CD24, ...)
             AERO      = version of the aerosol mechanism (5, 6, ...)
             SURF      = choose: (wSZ|nSZ) <=> with|no surf zone
             SAL       = choose: (wSL|nSL) <=> with|no salinity scaling
                                                (in the ocean file)
             FUN       = sea salt emission function (ov13, sp13, go03, ...)
             MODE      = integration/boundary mode (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)
             DATE      = date in julian format (2008001 for day 1 of year 2008)
   -- more flexible accessing of different ocean files via namespace and new
       naming conventions for the OCEAN file variables:
      --- wSZwSL: with surf zone (50 m) and with salinity scaling
      --- wSZnSL: with surf zone (50 m) and no salinity scaling
      --- nSZwSL: no surf zone (0 m) and with salinity scaling
      --- nSZnSL: no surf zone (0 m) and no salinity scaling
   -- definition of parameter 'modeIntegration' for ssemis_calc function:
       1: basic integration of source function between boundaries bMin, bIJ,
           bJK and bMax; if no salinity scaling is included in the source
           function then a basic salinity scaling is applied;
       2: like 1 but improved salinity scaling
       3: like 2 but salinity dependent shifting of integration boundaries
       4: modes are integrated from bMin to bMax; each mode of the emission
           function is mapped to one of the CMAQ modes (I, J or K); This
           approach is similar to the approach chosen in the SSEMIS module
           of CMAQ. It applies only when the emission function explicitly 
           consists of more than one mode.
 - modifications in ssemis_params:
   -- introduced function:
      --- reset_namesspace: It should be called from the ssemis_main scripts 
           in order to reset the namespace path(s) for the input and output 
           file. In introducing this function, one does not need to set all the 
           directories and file names on his/her own.
      --- reset_base_directories: The user can parse new values for dBASEIN1,
           dBASEIN2 and dBASEOUT which are the input and output directories.
   -- now three versions of OCEAN files exist in parallel in the namespace (see
       'general' for more details)
   -- adapted to new file naming conventions (see 'general')
   -- Now everywhere GRID_NAME (upper case grid name, e.g. CD06) is used. If
       lower case grid name is needed (variable grid_name, e.g. cd06), then the
       function tolower(GRID_NAME) is called. This makes accessing the 
       namespace variable more consistent.
   -- TODO: Make parameter setting in a way more consistent that dXXX and fXXX
       variables are part of namespace variable, as well.
 - ssemis_calc_* (general):
   -- adopted scripts to the new OCEAN file conventions in the namespace
       variable
   -- modified parameters which are parsed:
       new parameter:     surfzone (TRUE|FALSE) = load OCEAN file with(out) 
                                                    surf zone
       changed parameter: saltDependence -> modeIntegration (1|2|3|4) = choose
                           type and boundaries of integration (see 'general');
                           modeIntegration is not implemented in go03, yet, but 
                           only in sp13 (1, 2, 3) and ov13 (1, 4);
   -- TODO: optimized command line output;
 - modifications in ssemis_calc_ov13:
   -- The integration boundaries were adjusted. They depend on integrationMode.
       1: integration I mode: bMin to bIJ
                      J mode: bIJ to bJK
                      K mode: bJK to bMax
           Whereas, bJK is RH dependent.
       2, 3: like 1
       4: All five log-normal distributions are integrated from bMin to bMax.
           The distributions 1 and 2 are assigned to the I mode.
           The distributions 3 and 4 are assignet to the J mode.
           The distribution 5 is assigned to the K mode.
   -- The functions tnf was internally modified. Before the were 5 if-clauses.
      Now different parameters are in arrays which make the if-clauses obsolete.
      I expected an improvement of the run time. However, tests have shown the
      the run time of this specific function even increased by about 5%.
   -- The functions which are directly integrated are modified in a way that
      they are shorter (in 'lines of code'). Additionnaly, 'apply' is used
      instead of for-loops. I did not test the run time. In test with other
      functions I found out the apply for 5 items takes about 10% more run time
      than a for-loop. Here, we have a for-loop with 5 iterations, as well. 
      Therefore, the run time might have gotten worse. However, at the same time
      I re-ordered some basic camputation steps. Some tests for simpler
      functions showed that improvements of 10% and more in run time are 
      realistic.
 - modifications in ssemis_calc_sp13:
   -- TODO: adapt integration and function calls in a way that all needed
             parameters are parsed via the function header
            optimise functions which are integrated
 - ssemis_main_*:
   -- adapted to new file naming conventions (see 'general')
   -- adapted to using new functions of ssemis_params (see 'ssemis_params')
   -- adapted ssemis_calc call by adding new parameters
   -- cleaning of the code
   -- It is tested on which mashine the script is running. Depending on the
       mashines name (RZNP0466L|grpsrv09|grpsrv01) different working, input and
       output directories are set.
   -- The setting of some parameters is more generalised so that filename
       the things which are acutually calculated are more consistent. Amongst 
       others this means central setting of
      --- the version of the aerosol mechanism version,
      --- the choice whether surf zone emissions are included or not, and
      --- the integration mode,
       in the beginning.


v3.8.5
 - ssemis_main_*:
   -- External arguments can be parsed so that they do not have to be changed 
       in the scripts. This makes it easiert to start several calculation
       processes with different parameters.
   -- variables which contain the version numbers have more general names, now
   -- Base directories are automatically set depending on the computer. 
       Currently, they are set to non-standard values when we are on GRPSRV01.
 - ssemis_start (new script):
   -- Script thought for calling from command line;
   -- parse sea salt emissions function as command line argument instead of
       calling the function directly
 - ssemis_funs:
   -- new function: ssemis_read_args
      --- Reads out input arguments from the argument string which is parsed
           when a start script is called from the command line.
      --- It is called by ssemis_main_* and ssemis_start


v3.8.6
 - ssemis_fun:
   -- write_ssemis:
      --- hour in TFLAG was shifted by one hour
      --- HISTORY attribute now contains the version of the ssemis tools
   -- ssemis_read)args:
      --- empty argument string threw an error in the past
      --- now it returns empty arguments / arguments of length 0
 - ssemis_calc_*:
   -- variables which contain the version numbers have more general names, now
   -- Old: When errors during the integration process are catched they are
       parsed as warnings. Update: more parameters are given out, now.
 - ssemis_calc_ov13:
   -- Now, if an error occurs during the integration then the possibly wrong 
       output value is taken and a warning is thrown. Before the change, the 
       error was thrown and the integration was stopped. Commonly, the errors
       occured when the function was close to zero and the ration between
       absolute error and integrated value became too large. This feature has
       been already added at some placed in ssemis_calc_sp13 before.
   -- The second and third moments were twice multiplied by PI and PI/6*rho.
       It should be done only once. With rho_SeaSalt = 2, the latter value
       is about 1.047198 which does not change the mass flux much.
   -- Ovadnevaites sea salt emission functions were internally denoted as SP*
       which was a copy+paste error from the time when the script was created.
       The names were corrected.
   -- The run time was reduced by 3/4 in comparison to version 3.8.5. However,
       the improvement is not that strong to version prior to version 3.8.5 
       since in v3.8.5 a lot of changes were performed. These changes made the
       code shorter and better readable. At the same time the run time 
       increased considerably.
 - ssemis_calc_sp13:
   -- integration errors due to possible divergence of the function are catched
       now and parsed as warnings.
   -- in its first and second definition interval, MA03 is integrated 
       analytically
   -- on its third definition interval, MA03 is integrated analytically if
        SST >= 275.6 K; for SST < 275.6 K MA03 is negative for some particle
        diameters; in the latter case, still the integration routine is applied
   -- The runtime is reduced by 30% to 40% by solving the MA03 parameterization
        analytically. Currently, most time (2/7) is consumed by calling the 
        pmax.int function for providing positiv-only results.exit
