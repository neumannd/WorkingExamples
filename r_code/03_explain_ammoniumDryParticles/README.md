## R

### 03_explain_ammoniumDryParticles
The script `readme_standardname_problem.R` generates a pdf file containing 
three plots. There plots visualize schematically (a) how atmospheric particles
are in reality, (b) what specific variable names actually mean, and (c) how 
atmospheric particles are represented in many atmospheric chemistry transport
models.

The plot is used in a readme of a data set published
[at CERA](http://cera-www.dkrz.de/WDCC/ui/Compact.jsp?acronym=CCLM_CMAQ_HZG_2008). 
In future the data will be available under the doi 
10.1594/WDCC/CCLM_CMAQ_HZG_2008.
