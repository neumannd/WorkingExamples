## R

### 14_convertBSH 
The scripts `read_data_v09.R` and `read_data_BSHcmod3_v09.R` read in text 
output files of the BSHcmod4 and BSHcmod3, respectively, and write the data 
into new netCDF files. Prior to the upload at github, the code was cleaned
up (some out-commented lines were remove) but no comments were added since 
5th Feb. 2015.

These scripts do not run out of the box because some input data is missing.
If you are working with BSH data in the original text format and would like
to use my code you are welcome to contact me.
